# Team Project: INDELible

### Members: Chris Fiscus & Glen Morrison

The purpose of our project will be to identify indels in resequencing data from *Arabidopsis thaliana* and ask the following questions:  

1. Where do indels occur across the genome?  
2. Is indel length related to genomic position? 

For our data, we are proposing to use the 80 *A. thaliana* libraries that were sequenced as part of: 
Cao, J. et al. Whole-genome sequencing of multiple Arabidopsis thaliana populations. Nat. Genet. 43, 956â€“963 (2011).  

At the conclusion of this project we intend to deliver an interactive Shiny application. We will plot the distribution of indels identified in these samples genome-wide and subsetted by chromosome in genomic windows with the window size chosen by the user. We will also plot median indel size for each of these windows. 

### Pipeline
1. Download reference genome and index with bwa (0_setup_ref.sh)- produce an indexed reference genome.  
2. Download, quality trim, and align sequencing reads to the *A. thaliana* reference genome (1_dl_align.sh)- produce BAM files. 
3. Identify variants with freebayes (2_call_snps)- produce vcf. 
4. Filter variants with vcffilter (3_filter_vcf.sh)- produce filtered vcf. 
5. Extract indel size and position from filter VCF using a custom Python script (4_indel_size_and_position.py) write to an outfile. 
6. Plot results in a Shiny application (shiny_app/).  

To run the pipeline run each script in order (0_setup_ref.sh, 1_dl_align.sh etc.). 

### Results  
The filtered vcf produced by step 4 above is hosted on figshare at the following [link](https://figshare.com/s/77cb4ee59e590e5058d8). It has been compressed with BGZip to save disk space. 

The Shiny app that we produced is available [here](shinylink).
